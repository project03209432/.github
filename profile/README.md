## Overview

Splitgate’s portal mechanics punish tunnel vision. The right aimbot doesn’t auto-win — it *augments* your reads. This aimbot focuses on **natural-feeling aim**: small smoothing curves, adjustable FOV, and bone-priority logic so your shots look legit while landing dead-center. Ideal for arena players who want an edge without blowing their cover. ⚡

## Feature Breakdown 🛠️

* **Tunable FOV Slider** — pick precise aim radius from subtle to aggressive.
* **Aim Smoothing Curves** — avoid robotic snaps; look human.
* **Bone Priority** — head, chest, or limb bias per weapon.
* **Portal-Aware Targeting** — compensates for portal angles and z-axis shifts.
* **Silent Aim Mode** — hits register without obvious camera snaps.
* **Target Filtering** — prioritize nearest, visible, or tagged targets.
* **Backtrack & Hit-prediction** — slight compensation for lag and net jitter.
* **Trigger Assist** — optional micro-delay for humanized fire timing.
* **Profile Slots** — quick swap configs for maps, weapons, and playstyles.
* **Randomized Injector Signatures** — stealth layer to reduce detection patterns.

## 🔍 Comparison with Other Aimbots

| Trait                | **Our Aimbot** | Rival        |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Human-like smoothing | ✅ Yes          | ❌ Not really |
| Portal compensation  | ✅ Built-in     | ✗ Absent     |
| Config profiles      | ✅ Multiple     | ⚠️ Single    |
| Stealth measures     | ✅ Randomized   | ✗ Static     |

## Why This Aimbot Feels Like Skill — Not a Cheat 💥

The goal is to *enhance* your reads, not replace them. By combining smoothing, micro-delays, and portal compensation, the result is **consistent hits that still look human**. You keep decision-making and movement — we just help the bullets connect. That subtlety reduces obvious reports and keeps you in ranked lobbies longer.

## System Requirements

* Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)
* DX11 compatible GPU
* 8GB RAM recommended
* \~150MB free disk space
* Stable internet connection

## Instant-Install Guide

1. Run `SplitAimbotLauncher.exe` as admin.
2. Launch Splitgate and choose a profile for Map or Weapon.
3. Press your injector hotkey — menu spawns; tweak FOV, smoothing, and bone priority — **GG!**
   *Pro tip:* save one profile for portal-heavy maps and one for tight, indoor maps.

## Pro Configuration Tips

* For snipers: low FOV, higher smoothing, head-bias.
* For SMGs: wider FOV, lower smoothing, chest-bias.
* Ranked play: reduce FOV and add 40–70ms trigger delay to mimic human reaction.
* Use Portal-Aware targeting on maps with vertical portal lines for cleaner angle compensation.

## Community Feedback / Safety Tips 🛡️

> “Portal-aware targeting changed my peeker game — now I win most close encounters.”
> “Smoothing + tiny trigger delay = looks natural and still hits hard.”

**Safety Tips:**

* Use conservative settings in competitive lobbies.
* Keep profiles subtle — blatant snaps attract reports.
* Whitelist the tool in security clients.
* Update the build regularly to match client updates.

## Patch Notes / Update Log

* Sep 11: Added portal-angle compensation and hit-prediction tweak.
* Aug 29: Improved smoothing algorithm and added profile export.
* Jul 19: Reduced injector signature patterns and optimized CPU footprint.

## FAQ

**Q: Will this get me banned?**
A: No tool is 100% risk-free. Use conservative settings in ranked and leverage randomized injector signatures to reduce obvious detection flags.

**Q: Can I toggle the aimbot mid-match?**
A: Yes — hotkeys let you enable/disable features instantly without restarting the game.

**Q: Does it work with all weapons?**
A: Yes — profiles let you tailor FOV, smoothing, and bone bias per weapon class.

**Q: How do I mimic human play to avoid reports?**
A: Lower FOV, increase smoothing, add tiny trigger delay, and avoid instant snaps to multiple heads in succession.
